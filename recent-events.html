The realistic design of simulation enables the learner to transfer what they have learned in the simulated setting to the clinical setting in comparison to other methods of education, for example online course modules or didactic lecture (Merchant, 2012). Scenario-based simulation is often only provided in larger hospital facilities or academic settings. However, this type of learning is invaluable for the smaller community or rural hospitals as well.</p><p> Mercy Hospital Washington is an acute care hospital offering comprehensive critical care, medical, surgical, obstetric, and pediatric services. Mercy Hospital Washington began utilizing scenario-based simulation for multidisciplinary training and education several years ago. More recently, the hospital developed a complete simulation training lab, which although small, effectively simulates a patient room and provide realistic training for its co-workers. The training includes scenarios such as detecting a patient experiencing a stroke, taking the patient to CT, using the hospital’s Telestroke technology cart, and actually delivering TPA to the patient. Facilitators also run the simulation manikin remotely, to avoid interfering with co-workers participating in the scenario. The simulation lab is used extensively in Mercy Hospital Washington’s Nursing Fellowship and PCA Fellowship programs.</p><p> Mercy’s use of simulation is not restricted to its simulation lab. The hospital also provides scenario-based education through the use of mock codes. It is also expanding its out-of-the-lab training to include simulated experiences in the labor and delivery department and training of the hospital’s rapid response team.</p><p> Simulation should not be restricted to large facilities or academic settings, but should be available in all clinical settings large and small. A quote from the aviation industry is a fantastic example of why simulation is so valuable:</p><p>“Pilots don’t spend their training time flying straight and level. In simulator training, we’re doing nothing but flying in all sorts of emergencies. Even emergencies become just another set of procedures when repeatedly trained”</p><p>- Spencer, 2008</p><p> The statement is true for all clinical environments.</p></div></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">St. Louis Simulation Interest Group — © 2019 <small>All Rights Reserved</small></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://github.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
